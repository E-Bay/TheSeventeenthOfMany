<h1>Inner Join</h1>
    <p>Inner join is the process of selecting similar data in different tables. To do this process we first have to use Key Words or what we call them in class "Words Of Power!" These words being "SELECT" "FROM" "WHERE" or "ORDER BY". These are the words that we have started to learn. These each have different uses and different jobs, not to mention they are not cap sensitive. It is advised, however, that you capitalize these words as they are important and it helps organize the process better. INNER JOIN is a new word that, as mentioned above, takes the data from two tables; one of these is used after the "FROM" Key Word and the other is put after the "INNER JOIN" Key Word. We then use the "ON" word to tell what we are selecting to be equal. After this is put into the SQL we are given the values in the column selected and in the two tables selected.</p>
<h1>What is a Data Scientist and How is it Different?</h1>
    <p>While Computer Scintists deal with the study of computer design and all things to do with the wonderful technology called a "Computer" a Data scientist uses these tools to help them research data, study the structures of the data and help them pool information from the data they have. Both do have similarities however, a vast usage of technology to help them do their job and many different languages they can utilize to perform their given tasks.</p>
